VVR group undergraduate students Nikolaos Tsagkas and Ioannis Koutoulogenis, supervised by Associate Professor Konstantinos Moustakas, won the “Best Student Innovation Challenge Award” at the Hyundai sponsored SIC-Mobility Challenge in the context of the IEEE Worlhaptics conference that was held in Tokyo, Japan on July 9-12, 2019.

Initially, the group had been accepted as one of the seven finalists of the challenge and were invited to demonstrate their application on-site. The developed awarded prototype, entitled “Gamified haptic UI for increasing trust in autonomous vehicles”, included both hardware implementation of a wearable haptic sensor and actuator, use of the off-the-shelf Ultrahaptics mid-air haptic rendering device and a Virtual Reality software system whose aim is to gamify and increase trust on the use of autonomous vehicles.
