In order to contribute to the acquisition of sEMG data, particularly from devices that do not require professional calibration, we developed a sizeable sEMG database. Our dataset, MyoUP, was inspired by the Ninapro database and all of the recorded hand-gestures, presented in: 
[[here](/assets/pdf/MyoUP.pdf)]. The recording device we used was the Myo Armband, by Thalmic labs. The Myo Armband is a relatively cheap and easy-to-wear device, with a sampling frequency of 200Hz and 8 dry sEMG channels that has been widely adopted in scientific research.

## Dataset Info

The MyoUP database contains recordings from 8 intact subjects (3 females, 5 males; 1 left handed, 7 right handed; age 22.38 Â± 1.06 years). The acquisition process was divided into three parts: 5 basic finger movements, 12 isotonic and isometric hand configurations and 5 grasping hand-gestures. Volunteers became accustomed with the procedure before performing each set of exercises. Subjects were instructed to repeat each gesture 5 times, for a 5sec period, interleaved with 5sec interruptions to avoid muscle fatigue. A supervisor assisted the subjects in wearing the Myo Armband to their dominant hand so that the device would be placed in a comfortable position for the subject and the device would detect the sEMG signals accurately. The sEMG was visible to the subject on a screen along with a picture of the hand-gesture that had to be performed.

## Hand Gesture Recognition via sEMG signals 

Since the results of this research where rather promising, a real-time hand gesture recognition model was developed, by designing a CNN and training it with the MyoUP dataset. More information regarding the implementation can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/tsagkas/sEMG-HandGestureRecognition">here</a>
