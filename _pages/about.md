Last November I completed with distinction the **Artificial Intelligence master's programme** at the University of Edinburgh. For my master's dissertation project I worked on a novel inference algorithm for [generative capsule models](https://github.com/tsagkas/capsules), under the supervision of [Prof. Chris Williams](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/).

In 2019, I was awarded with a **Diploma of Electrical and Computer Engineering**, from the University of Patras, in Greece (graduated 4th in my class out of 202 students â€“ GPA: 8.11 out of 10). I completed my ECE Diploma thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Athanassios Skodras](http://www.ece.upatras.gr/skodras/), researching the use of CNNs for [real-time hand-gesture recognition](/projects/2_project/) via sEMG signals. Our work was presented at the IISA'19 international conference. 

Moreover, working under the supervision of [Prof. Konstantinos Moustakas](http://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/members/konstantinos-moustakas/) at the [VVR group](http://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/), I researched the use of Haptics in self-driving vehicles, by taking part in the 2nd Student Challenge in Automotive Haptics, at the [WHC'19](http://www.worldhaptics2019.org/) in Tokyo, Japan, where our team received the "Best Student Innovation Challenge Award".
